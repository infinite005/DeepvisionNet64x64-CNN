# DeepvisionNet64x64-CNN

A simple and effective **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for image classification with 64x64 input size.  
Designed for binary classification with data augmentation, training, and fine-tuning capabilities.

---

## Model Performance

- Final Training Accuracy: 99%
- Final Validation Accuracy: 97%
- These accuracy values represent the modelâ€™s performance on the training and validation datasets, respectively.


## Features

- Input images of size 64x64 with 3 color channels (RGB)  
- Architecture includes 3 convolutional layers with MaxPooling and Dropout to reduce overfitting  
- Uses `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation  
- Supports fine-tuning on new datasets without training from scratch  
- Model saving and loading in `.keras` format  
- Training history plots for accuracy and loss

 ## Training the Initial Model
python Main_CNN_without_fine_tune.py
Uses data augmentation to improve model robustness
Saves the trained model as CNN_model.keras
---


## Fine-tuning the Model
After initial training, the model can be fine-tuned on new data located in the DOGS folder:
Freezes earlier layers to preserve learned features
Trains only the last layers for 10 epochs
Saves the fine-tuned model as CNN_model_finetuned.keras
------

## Using the Saved Model
Load the fine-tuned model for inference or further training:

import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('CNN_model_finetuned.keras')
